                            I am an aspiring programmer, looking to one day start
                            a company of my own and make something great. I hope
                            to be able to make the things that people have always
                            wanted, but don't know how to do on their own. I
                            believe that, in this time, anything imaginable can
                            be made; all you need is to write the right code.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I was 9 years old, I began making websites at the
                            Virtual Ventures summer camp at Carleton University, where
                            I first became interested in programming. I then went on
                            to learn a lot more on my own time while making websites
                            for my friends to use, as well as for some school projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In my free time I also often make games, mainly for Windows
                            with GameMaker, but I have done a few others in HTML5, Java and C++.
                            In making games I learned about object oriented programming,
                            collision detection, and lots of other useful concepts.
                            I try to participate in as many game making contests as I can,
                            including the GMC Jam and Ludum Dare compo. I have placed as
                            high as 16th in the GMC Jam.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've taken a few courses in high school which taught concepts such as
                            recursion and basic dynamic programming in C++. I have entered a number
                            of contests using C++, and done well, placing in the top of my school.
                            Java was touched on too, though it was left for the students who were
                            ahead to learn it while the rest of the class caught up and was essentially
                            self taught.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I am currently working on the second year of my
                            Bachelor of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As of now, I have had significant experience working with:
                            HTML5;
                            CSS and SCSS;
                            JavaScript and TypeScript and Angular;
                            NodeJS and NPM;
                            PHP;
                            MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB;
                            C++ and SDL;
                            GameMaker and GameMaker Language;
                            Git and GitHub;
                            Ruby and Ruby on Rails;
                            Racket;
                            Go;
                            and Java.

                                After making Catan (below) I felt like porting
                                another board game, but doing it better. I decided
                                to do Tokaido, because it's another game I wanted to
                                play with my friends. It uses the same sort of structure
                                and logic, but much more organized and looks way better.
                                Graphics are by <a href="http://naiiade.deviantart.com/">Naiiade</a>,
                                and were scanned from the physical copy of the board game.

                                Feel free to clone it off GitHub, set up a server,
                                and play it with your friends.

                                Browser version of The Settlers of Catan, the board game by Klaus Teuber.

                            <p>
                                Due to the lack of good, reliable, online multiplayer
                                Catan games, I decided to make one so I could play
                                with my friends from afar. It is done using SCSS
                                and ES6 Javascript, along with NodeJS in the backend.
                                In addition to just Catan, it includes a chatbox
                                to communicate with your opponents, and will have a
                                playlist feature so players can share music.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The game has been finished and playable, but I hope
                                to someday get around to making it look better and
                                work smoother.

                                This is a simple Mario style platformer I made for
                                the ISU of Grade 12 Computer Science, made over a
                                few weeks in class. I used C++ with SDL2 for the
                                graphics. I wrote all the code, though some was
                                based off <a href="http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/">this</a>
                                tutorial. The graphics are from various Internet
                                sources, and the music from <a href="http://incompetech.com/">Incompetech</a>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I also created a system for turning BMP files into
                                levels, using different colours to represent the
                                different types of objects. The code for that is
                                included in the Github repo.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It is not quite finished yet, but the version I
                                had working for class is available for download.
                                There are some things wrong in that one, but I'll
                                keep the source up to date with current progress.
                                I hope to get my own graphics and music and polish
                                this up well enough to distribute some day.

                                You live in a world where everything is white. You
                                are white, the walls are white - everything. But
                                one day you see a spark, and it's not. With your
                                new discovery, travel around and see what else
                                the world has to hold. Bring back all the colours!

                                <i>White</i> is a smooth, relaxing, somewhat puzzling platformer.
                                I thought of the idea for the game a long time
                                ago, and had worked out an early prototype. I lost
                                that file though, and I left it alone for a while.
                                I started it up again later, just by coincidence
                                at the same time as the <a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=606848&page=3#entry4492169">GMC Jam #13</a>.
                                I submitted an <a href="/game/White-Pirate_Edition.exe">early version</a>
                                to that and it placed 19th overall.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the GMC Jam was over, I went on to complete
                                the game. Eventually I published it, first on
                                <a href="http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/white/35169/">GameJolt</a>,
                                <a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/white1">indieDB</a> and
                                <a href="http://oinkiguana.itch.io/white">itch.io</a> as a downloadable
                                game, and later as an HTML5 game on
                                <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/OinkIguana/white">Kongregate</a> and
                                <a href="http://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/647031">Newgrounds</a>.
                                Unfortunately the HTML5 version does not run as
                                smoothly as the standalone executable, and so it
                                has lower ratings where it is published, but it was
                                more an experiment to try and publish it properly.
                                In the end it was 8 months of on and off work,
                                in which I created every part of the game - code,
                                graphics, music and sound. <i>White</i> is my
                                personal favourite of the games I've made.

                                a better life in the Nobles' Land. Fix up the old

                                <i>The Catapult</i> is a short RPG, and was
                                created in 48 hours for Ludum Dare <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-30/?action=preview&uid=38828" target="_blank">Ludum Dare #30</a>.
                                It was made using GameMaker:Studio, and was based
                                off an RPG engine that I had created earlier. The
                                graphics I drew myself, though music and sound were
                                created using a random generator, all within the

                                It was made in GameMaker:Studio, using the same
                                RPG engine as <i>The Catapult</i>. I drew some of
                                the graphics, but most were taken from the Internet,
                                along with the sound and music.

                                This was made as a grade 11 English project. The

                                <i>Animal Farm</i> by George Orwell. It's an RTS,
                                inspired by <i>StarCraft</i> and <i>Age of Empires</i>.
                                I made a few of the graphics, but most were taken
                                from the Internet. The dialog sprites and menu music
                                are taken from the 1955 animated film.

                                This game is based off of William Golding's
                                <i>Lord of the Flies</i> and created for a grade
                                10 English assignment. It's a collection of
                                minigames that are meant to prove the theme of
                                evil being a part of every person, whether they
                                know it or not. The game is a bit buggy due to
                                some updates to GameMaker. I took the graphics
                                and sound from the Internet, and the music is from
                                Donkey Kong Country.

                                I made this game for grade 10 History class. It
                                is a very simple platform shooter, with each level
                                based off of one of Canada's major conflicts. It
                                was coded in GameMaker, with graphics and sound
                                from the Internet.

                                song, poem or other form of media, to send to a

                                <i>Taco Quest</i> was my first big project.
                                I made it mostly with the drag and drop features
                                of GameMaker when I was very young, so it's not
                                particularly impressive compared to my current
                                games. There are a few bugs here and there, and
                                the game isn't all that fun. I used the default
                                example graphics that came with GameMaker and some
                                music and sound I found online.

                                <i>The Ghost Game</i> was the first game I ever
                                made. I started it at Virtual Ventures summer camp,
                                and finished it after. I then went on to make a
                                <i>The Ghost Game 2</i>, which I combined with
                                the first to make the <i>Complete Edition</i> that
                                is available for download below. It's
                                a very basic platformer which I made using GameMaker
                                and its example graphics.

                                In grade 7 one of my friends had a WordPress site
                                which my classmates and I would go on, kind of like
                                our own personal forum/group chat. Eventually he
                                stopped paying for it, so I decided to make a similar
                                version of it, but from scratch.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I copied many of his features at first, such as
                                achievements, the chat box, a forum, and profiles.
                                I then went on to add more things such as quizzes
                                and games
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Later, when HTML5 came out, I decided to redo the
                                whole thing using the new features. That remake
                                is what is there now today. It's not as well used
                                anymore, but I still keep an eye on it.

                                Although it is no longer used officially, this was
                                the website for the Nepean High School student
                                run newspaper <i>Knightwatch</i>. They have since
                                fallen back to using a Google site, but I keep the
                                original hosted on my own server.

                                All the issues and articles are imported from a
                                set of folders and text files organized and formatted
                                a specific way. This was to make uploading an article
                                require no knowledge of programming.

                                I made the theme to my own Tumblr account. Making
                                a theme was actually the reason I decided to get
                                an account. I wanted to make it stand out from the
                                rest, so I drew it custom graphics. I then decided
                                to make it respond to the current time, the weather,
                                and the seasons. It also has a few things that are
                                a placed little differently each time.

                                I also have made a few other Tumblr themes, which
