              Long ago, back in my summer camp days, one of the leaders introduced
              us to &ldquo;hacking&rdquo;. While he didn't really teach us how to
              hack anything, he let us pretend that we were hacking his website.
              In reality, all it was was a puzzle, hidden in the source code behind
              a textbox, in which we were to find the password that would allow us
              move on to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a bunch of kids who had never learned much more about code than
              HTML, the game was pretty difficult. After banding together to
              eventually break through all seven levels, I was left with the
              feeling that it could have been more.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fast forward to now, and it is my turn to present this puzzle to
              you. Maybe you'll learn something&hellip; Or maybe you'll have something
              to teach me when you're done.

                Currently available in two languages (JavaScript and C++), this game
                engine contains a number of useful features for building your own
                games with no additional software.
              </p>

            <div class="content">
              <p>
                Every time I make a game, I end up reaching deeper into the inner
                workings of whichever engine I happen to be using. After years of
                using them, I took a shot at making an engine myself, based on
                features I've seen in the others. This is my third (I think), and
                most successful attempt and a reasonably easy to use and useful
                engine.
              </p>
              <p>
                As it stands, I'd say it is as much a proof of concept as it is a
                fully-functioning library. Though it may never become a full game
                engine, I've been able to make some pretty decent prototypes with it
                with little difficulty. If you are interested, I encourage you to
                try it out. If it's missing a good feature you need, I'll add it in,
                or you can put it in yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is currently available in two languages (JavaScript and C++),
                but I plan to add more in the near future (Ruby or Haskell?).
                Detailed documentation is available in the repository.

                Originally created to teach a few of my friends, Sandy Simulator
                is a series of lessons in the basics of programming using
                <a href="http://repl.it">repl.it</a>. Though Python is
                often the language of choice for teaching, I have always liked the

                As of now, I have almost no &ldquo;students,&rdquo; so I haven't
                really built it out too much. If it ever starts gaining popularity
                I'm willing to add more content, and maybe more advanced tutorials

                Being a common feature of games, this Dialog System has provided
                an example of how to manage and display complex dialogues for over
                2000 GameMaker developers. This (or some variation of it) is the

                Since most games, RPGs in particular, have some sort of dialogue
                between the player and the other characters, I found myself using
                the same sort of system in each game. Eventually, I decided to
                polish it and publish it on the original (now extinct)
                <a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=589971">GameMaker Community</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                My example includes a number of important dialog features, such as
                displaying the text typewriter-style, font and colour changes,
                splash images, string input and more. These problems often troubled
                newer GameMaker developers, so in its time, this example was well
                received by the community. In the end, it has reached over 2000
                people, and was used to develop this game,

                &ldquo;How do I make an inventory?&rdquo; The disappointingly low
                number of high-quality examples to follow inspired me to make this

                when I looked there were shockingly few good examples on the
                forums (pretty much none). Rather than ask again, I ended up
                hacking one together myself. Eventually, I had made what I thought
                to be a pretty good system, and so I published it on the
                <a href="http://gmc.yoyogames.com/index.php?showtopic=535228">GMC</a>
                in hopes of reducing the number of inventory questions.

                After being reviewed by the moderators, my example was immediately
                published to the &ldquo;Staff Choice&rdquo; section. Since then, my
                example has reached over 3000 people.
