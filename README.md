===========

This is my personal profile website, used to showcase my projects and skills.
All of the code was written by me, using no external libraries or frameworks.

The page consists of 5 sections which parallax over each other (for supported
browsers anyway).

The games/sites sections show a list of my projects, which can be clicked on for
more detail. Screenshots are listed for some games, which can also be clicked on
for a closer view.
