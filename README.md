===========

This is the website I use to showcase my projects and skills. I made it completely by hand for this purpose only. You can take the code and do with it as you please, but I don't know how much use that is. Although it is a .php file I use for the index, there is currently no PHP code actually in it, so all is visible if you were to view the source from the page.

The page consists of 5 sections, which parallax over each other. They have triangles which I put there for "fun" but it turns out triangles are not particularly clean to code. Each section is separated in left and right, with some content in each.  

The games/sites section show a list of my projects, which can be clicked on to view more detail. The descriptions for each are just hidden elements on the page, nothing called externally, as it will be faster to load this way. There are screenshots listed for each game, which open in a popup when clicked.

The site does not support mobile or other devices with small screens yet, but that will be added soon.
