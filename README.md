===========

This is the website I use to showcase my projects and skills. I made it completely by hand for this purpose only.
You can take the code and do with it as you please, but I don't know how much use that is. Although it is a .php
file I use for the index, there is currently no PHP code actually in it, so all is visible if you were to view
the source from the page.

The page consists of 5 sections, which parallax over each other. They have triangles which I put there for "fun"
but it turns out triangles are not particularly clean to code. I'd not suggest using them if I were to do this 
again. 

The games/sites section show a list of my projects, which can be clicked on to view more detail. The descriptions
for each are just hidden elements on the page, nothing called externally, as it will be faster to load this way.

I plan to add in some screenshots for each game soon, as well as a few other images for the about and top sections.
