              <p>
                More than ten years ago, the small child that was me wrote his first line
                of code, and it led to one of the uglist websites to have ever graced
                the Internet. Since then I have come a long way, and I hope to go much
                further yet.
              </p>
              <p>
                Currently I am studying for my BCS from the University of Waterloo,
                in hopes of someday finding a career in software development. Until
                then I continue to work on my own personal projects, some of which
                can be seen below. With each, I try to learn at least one new thing,
                be it a new concept, technology or language.
              </p>
              <p>
                Though my biggest hobby is working on projects like these, I also dabble
                in wood carving and baked goods, and I'll never turn down a chance to
                travel the world.

                Raised in a world where everything is white, one small rectangle
                sees something unusual &mdash; a little flash of something else.
                As he moves closer, he realises there is more to this world and
                soon finds himself on an amazing adventure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Heading out from his house, he travels the world.
                He meets many new people and sees things he could never have
                imagined, but eventually he gets tangled in something much bigger
                than his own adventure.

                After months of hard work, Dave has finally been awarded Employee
                of the Month! As a reward, he is given a trip to Brockville!
                Unfortunately for this ordinary man, his train ride there turns
                out to be unusually perilous...
              </p>
              <p>
                Short on weapons, Dave takes a fork and fights his way through
                hordes of monsters, hoping to find out what is going on with this
                train.

              <p>
                Today is the day of the class fieldtrip to the local forest to
                learn about nature! Abby doesn't want to learn though, so she
                takes her best friend Elliot and they split from the group.
              </p>
              <p>
                After wandering for some time, the two get lost. Abby stays determined,
                but Elliot is scared by every noise, worried that it might be a monster.
                Abby tries to keep him calm but once monsters really do show
                up, there's no chance. They have to make it back to the group!
